**Project Name:** WORDCLOUDS WITH PRAW REDDIT API & PYTHON

**Description:** ChatGPT is helpful with a lot of things. GPS for life. But as a data analyst, I find it especially useful for generating pythong scripts. I think compared to a language like SQL for instance, its a lot easier to employ python code directly outputted from ChatGPT because it more often has all of the context it needs right off the bat...whereas with SQL, ChatGPT doesnt have access to your database or tables...you have to describe all of that in the prompt. So, with that in mind, in this project I demonstrate the quick and easy utility of ChatGPT for generating python scripts. The use case is connecting to the reddits PRAW API to generate wordclouds from posts.

**Usage:** Generate wordclouds based on the title or selftext of top or new posts in specificed subreddit

**CHATGPT Prompt:** Can you generate a python script that pulls Title, SelfText, Creation_Date, Score, and number of comments for the top posts in the r/Coffee subreddit? Then can you store the output in a pandas dataframe? Then can you generate a wordcloud from the SelfText?
